        <h1 id = "css">css</h1>
        <pre id = firist_lesson>so okay css. we can add an id to any 
            thing in html and we can call it in the 
            css file using # and we can also put a class 
            and it will be mention in css using . yse a dot 
            and * means all elements.

              = descendant
            > = child
            ~ = general sibling
            + - adjacent sibling

            we can add a word after an element that trigger something
            for example : h1:hover this will trigger when hover over 
            a h1 elemnt there is also a:link used to change the propties 
            of a link and there is :active this trigger when the mouse is 
            holding the element and visited which mark a visited websites
            more on that <a id="here" href="https://youtu.be/HGTJBPNC-Gw?t=8952&si=ljovzS8Y0JibLRWN" target="_blank">Here</a>.
            we can also add not to any of these to reverse the order

            after an element we can add :: then a keyword to do some crazy stuff
            for example ::frirt-letter to target a first letter of something
            ::firist line , there is also ::selection we can change a selection
            ::before at the begning of a st ::after at the end.

                propties above and the the syntex goes like this
                border: "-border-width" "-border-style" "-border-color"
                for example:<br><span>border: 3px  solid white;</span>

            </dd>

            <dt>-text-shadow</dt>
            <dd>makes shadows for a text and the syntex goes like things
                -text-shadow : width height blur color , and we can add more 
                shadows to the text using commaa for example:
                <br><span>text-shadow : 3px 3px 5px red , 2px 2px 0px blue</span>
            </dd>

            <dd>same as -text-shadow.</dd>

            <dt>-margin</dt>
            <dd><img src="borders.png"class ="pic">this is a margin which is like
            the outer layer of an onion it can be changed in pixels 
            and there is also margin-bottm margin-right etc......
            and there is also auto we can apply to margin which is can be used to make
            something in the middel for example</dd>
            
            <br><br>
            <dt>-float</dt>
            <dd>we can do floar: left; or right this will make text is beside a pic
                like on the pic above </dd>

            <dt><a href="https://hentaihaven.xxx/watch/overflow/episode-1/" target="_blank" id="nob">-overflow</a></dt>
            <dd>the -overflow prevents text or items to overflow from 
                a specfic box "its better to asign the height of the box before doing it"
                and there is diffrent types of overflows like:
                visble, hidden, clip, scroll, auto
            </dd>

            <dt>-display</dt>
            <dd>propety specfiy how if /how and elment is displayed 
                for example :
                display : inline; this will make the div or span or whatever
                inline of the text besides it
                ,block will make the text a block like the div which means you can 
                apply a width and a height to it .
                and none it make the element invisible and make it like it didnt exict
            </dd>
            
            <dt>-visibility</dt>
            <dd>we can set it to hidden but it doesnt make the elment
                vanish it just make it invisible but it will still exict
            </dd>

            <dt>-position</dt>
            <dd>this can get 5 values firist is 
                <span>relative:</span> and this mean that the elemnt will be 
                positioned relative to it staring point.<span>fixed:</span>
                and this position the element relative to the viewport
                <span>absolute:</span>positioned relative to the nearest ancestor 
                the ancestor is like an elemnt inside a class for example a box
                and the elemnt is positioned in this box.<span>sticky:</span>
                which makes the element in it postion untill we scroll down then it 
                will be in top of the screen<span>static:</span>the default postion
                of the element. note that to change the postion we gotta use top , bottom
                , left , right.
            </dd>

            <dt>-background-image</dt>
            <dd>id adds a background image using this syntex:
                <br><span>background-image : url(the_background_image);</span>
                but if we made the background-image low resloution it will
                be repeated to make it not we add <span>background-repeat : no-repeat;</span>
                we can also position it using <span>background-postion</span> and like the
                postion : fixed propety we also have it in background <span>background-attachment</span>
                but after we done the picture will still be awful and not acullaly fixed so to do that
                we add this:<br><span>background-size: cover;</span>.
